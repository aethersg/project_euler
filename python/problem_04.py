# Solution to problem 4
# Problem Statement: Largest palindrome product
#
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
#

            n = str(i * j)
            if int(n) > ans:  # check the value is bigger then the previous one
                if n == n[::-1]:  # check if it is a palindrome
